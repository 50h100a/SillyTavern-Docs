### hnswlib wheel building error when installing ChromaDB

Before installing the ChromaDB module you must first do `one of the following`:

* Install Visual C++ build tools: <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>
* Install the `hnswlib` package with conda: `conda install -c conda-forge hnswlib`

### Error when installing Python requirements on Mac 

> ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch==2.0.0+cu117 

Mac does not support CUDA, so torch packages should be installed without CUDA support:

1. Open requirements.txt and requirements-complete.txt files with a Text Editor app.
2. Remove all `+cu117` parts from the package versions. Example: `torch==2.0.0+cu117` => `torch==2.0.0`
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again (change to `requirements-complete.txt` if needed.
