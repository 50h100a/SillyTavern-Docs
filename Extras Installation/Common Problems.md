# Common Problems with Extras Installation

### Getting an error when installing from requirements-complete.txt?

> ERROR: Could not build wheels for hnswlib, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects

Before installing the ChromaDB module you must first do one of the following:

* Install Visual C++ build tools: <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>

OR

* Install `hnswlib` with conda: `conda install -c conda-forge hnswlib`

---

### Missing modules?

You must specify a list of module names to be run in the `--enable-modules` command (`caption` provided as an example). See [Modules](#modules) section.

### What about mobile/Android/Termux? ü§î

There are some folks in the community having success running Extras on their phones via Ubuntu on Termux.

#### ‚ùó This is UNSUPPORTED

However, Extras was not made with mobile support in mind.
No support will be provided for people running Extras on their Android devices.
Direct all your questions to the creator of the guide instead.
