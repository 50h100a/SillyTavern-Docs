# Chat Completions

Chat completion APIs include OpenAI, Claude, and PaLM.
WindowAI & OpenRouter allows connection to these as well.

## OpenAI

### API key

**How to get:**

1. Go to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and sign in.
2. Use "[View API keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)" option to create a new API key.

**Important!**

*Lost API keys can't be restored! Make sure to keep it safe!*

## Claude

If you have access to Anthropic's Claude API:

- select 'Claude' for 'Chat Completion Source'
- Input your API key
- Click connect.

## WindowAI / OpenRouter

OpenRouter works by letting you use keys that they own, or your own keys.

It has a free trial, and paid access afterwards.

Don't have access to OpenAI / Claude APIs due to geolocking or waitlists? Use OpenRouter.
